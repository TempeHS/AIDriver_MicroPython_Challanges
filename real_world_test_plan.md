## Notes:

- Once the measurements arrive, I will fit MM_PER_SPEED_UNIT, wheel base, and optional slip factors so simulated displacement and turning match.
- Sensor datasets will drive adjustments to the ultrasonic origin offset, noise amplitude, and clipping thresholds.
- Time-response or lag data lets me decide whether to add acceleration smoothing, motor delay, or drift correction in updateKinematics.
