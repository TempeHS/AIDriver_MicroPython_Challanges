# Assembly Instructions

> [!Important]
> Before students begin, they should know:
>
> 1. During assembly, no parts should be forced, excessive force will break the components.
> 2. The motors should not be manually turned as it will break the plastic gears (that means no pushing and pulling the robot on the ground like a Tonka truck).
> 3. The robots battery power should always be turned off when connecting to a computer.
> 4. Make sure your robot has room to move and won't be stepped on when testing.
> 5. Batteries should be always removed for storage

## Step 1

**Assemble to axel for the front wheel.**

![Step 1 Visual](images/step_1.png "Step 1 Visual")

## Step 2

**Slide the omni wheel onto the middle of the axel.**

**Assemble the main chassis.**

## Step 3

**Attach the 3D Printed brackets for the battery holder and Microcontroller.**

## Step 4

**First insert the two motors into the 3D motor clip.**

**Second attach the motor clip to the chassis.**

## Step 5

**Attach the wheels to the motors.**

## Step 6

**Connect the wires to the screw terminals.**

## Step 7

**Attach the ultrasonic sensor to the robot and connect it to the processor.**

## Step 8 - Test the Hardware

1. Make sure your battery power switch is off.
2. Navigate to [https://lab-micropython.arduino.cc/](https://lab-micropython.arduino.cc/).
3. Sign in with Google (use your @education.nsw.gov.au account).
4. Follow these instructions to connect:

5. Copy and paste this code into `main.py`
6. Click <kbd>SAVE</KDB>
7. Disconnect your robot from your computer

> [!Caution]
> To avoid damaging your computer or robot place it on the floor in an area with enough space for it to move safely before powering it on.
