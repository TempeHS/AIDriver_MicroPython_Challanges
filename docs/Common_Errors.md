# Common Error Messages – AIDriver RP2040

This appendix lists common error messages you may see while working through the AIDriver challenges, what they mean in plain English, and how to fix them.

Use it as a quick reference when something goes wrong.

---

## 1. `NameError: name 'driver' is not defined`

**Example message:**

```text
NameError: name 'driver' is not defined
```

**What it means (plain English):**  
Python can’t find a variable or name called `driver`.

**Likely causes:**

- You created your robot with a different name (e.g. `my_robot = AIDriver()`) but later used `driver`.
- You mis-typed the name (e.g. `my_robt` vs `my_robot`).

**How to fix:**

1. Find where you created the robot (usually near the top of `main.py`).
2. Use exactly the **same name** everywhere you refer to it.
3. A simple pattern is:

   ```python
   my_robot = AIDriver()
   my_robot.drive_forward(200, 200)
   ```

---

## 2. `AttributeError: 'AIDriver' object has no attribute 'backward'`

**Example message:**

```text
AttributeError: 'AIDriver' object has no attribute 'backward'
```

**What it means:**  
The `AIDriver` class does not have a function called `backward`.

**Likely causes:**

- You used a name from a flowchart or from another language instead of the actual library function.
- You wrote:

  ```python
  my_robot.backward(200, 200)
  ```

  instead of:

  ```python
  my_robot.drive_backward(200, 200)
  ```

**How to fix:**

- Use the correct function names from the AIDriver library:
  - `drive_forward(right_speed, left_speed)`
  - `drive_backward(right_speed, left_speed)`
  - `rotate_left(turn_speed)`
  - `rotate_right(turn_speed)`
  - `brake()`
  - `read_distance()`

## 3. `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` (missing colon)

**Example message:**

```text
  File "main.py", line 12
    while driver.read_distance() == -1
                                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**What it means:**  
Python expected a `:` or some other symbol at the end of the line.

**Likely causes:**

- You forgot the colon (`:`) at the end of a `while`, `if`, `for`, or `def` line.

**How to fix:**

- Check the line the error points to (e.g. `line 12`) and make sure it ends with a colon:

  ```python
  while driver.read_distance() == -1:
      print("Robot too close")
  ```

---

## 4. `IndentationError: unexpected indent` / code not indented

**Example messages:**

```text
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

or

```text
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

**What it means:**  
Python is confused by how far your lines are indented.

**Likely causes:**

- Code inside a `while`, `if`, `for`, or `def` is not indented at all.
- Some lines inside the same block are indented differently.

**How to fix:**

- For a `while` loop, the body should be indented, for example:

  ```python
  while True:
      my_robot.drive_forward(200, 200)
      sleep(0.1)
  ```

- Make sure all lines inside the block start with the same number of spaces.

---

## 5. `ImportError: no module named 'aidriver'`

**Example message:**

```text
ImportError: no module named 'aidriver'
```

**What it means:**  
Python cannot find the `aidriver` library file.

**Likely causes:**

- `aidriver.py` is not in the `lib/` folder on the board.
- The file is mis-named (e.g. `AiDriver.py`, `aidriver (1).py`).

**How to fix:**

1. In the Arduino MicroPython Lab file view, make sure there is a `lib` folder.
2. Inside `lib`, check there is a file named **exactly** `aidriver.py`.
3. Use:

   ```python
   from aidriver import AIDriver
   ```

   at the top of your `main.py`.

---

## 6. Robot “does nothing” (no movement, no errors)

**What it looks like:**

- Program runs, no error is shown, but the robot does not move.

**Likely causes:**

- You never call a movement function inside your loop.
- Your loop is empty or only has `sleep()` statements.
- Speeds set too low (e.g. below ~120).

**How to fix:**

- Make sure your `while True:` loop contains commands like:

  ```python
  while True:
      my_robot.drive_forward(200, 200)
      sleep(0.1)
  ```

- Use speed values around `200` for reliable motion.

---

## 7. Robot freezes or keeps rebooting

**What it looks like:**

- The board disconnects, restarts, or stops responding while the program is running.

**Likely causes:**

- An infinite loop with **no `sleep()`** call (CPU never gets a break).
- Very tight loops that spam the console with prints.

**How to fix:**

- Always include a small delay in your main loop, for example:

  ```python
  while True:
      # your logic here
      sleep(0.05)  # 50 ms pause
  ```

- Reduce the number of `print()` calls inside fast loops.

---

## 8. Ultrasonic sensor always reads -1

**What it looks like:**

- `my_robot.read_distance()` returns `-1` every time.

**Likely causes:**

- Sensor is too close (< 20 mm) or too far (> 2000 mm) from any object.
- Sensor is pointing into open space.
- Wiring issue on TRIG/ECHO pins.

**How to fix:**

1. Place an object 10–50 cm in front of the sensor.
2. Check the wiring matches the assembly instructions.
3. Turn on AIDriver debug and watch the messages:

   ```python
   import aidriver
   from aidriver import AIDriver

   aidriver.DEBUG_AIDRIVER = True
   robot = AIDriver()
   ```

4. Run a simple distance test loop and see what the debug messages say.

---

If you see an error that is not listed here, try to:

1. Read the **first line** of the error message.
2. Note the **type** (e.g. `NameError`, `SyntaxError`, `AttributeError`).
3. Use that as a keyword to search in your docs or ask for help.
